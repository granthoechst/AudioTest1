# AudioTest1
This is the repository for my first Unity dynamic audio test. It is designed, developed and composed by me, Grant Hoechst. It was an exercise both in programming the audio systems and in composing a non-linear, module-based score.

Hope you enjoy! WASD or arrow keys to move, mouse to look. Check out the Builds folder for Mac, Windows, and Linux versions.
